# Wu-Tang Clan Name Generator

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. This app presents the user with 5 survey questions, and based on their answers, it randomly generates a Wu-Tang Clan-inspired name. The generated name will have a fun, Wu-Tang-style vibe, similar to the process behind how Childish Gambino came up with his name using a Wu-Tang name generator.

## Features

- **Survey Questions:** The app will ask the user 5 questions to personalize the name generation.
- **Random Name Generation:** Based on the user’s answers, the app will randomly generate a Wu-Tang Clan-inspired name.
- **Fun and Interactive:** The names will be quirky, creative, and definitely "Wu-Tang sounding" — like something you’d find in a rap battle.

## How it Works

1. **Survey Questions:** The user will be presented with a set of 5 questions. Example questions could include:
   - What’s your favorite animal?
   - What’s your favorite color?
   - What’s a random adjective that describes you?
   - What’s a place you’ve always wanted to visit?
   - What’s your favorite food?
   
2. **Name Generation:** Based on the user's answers, the app will generate a random Wu-Tang-inspired name. The generated name will combine elements from their answers in a creative and fun way, producing a name that sounds like it could belong to a member of the Wu-Tang Clan.

3. **Result Display:** Once the user completes the survey, the generated name will be displayed, with some fun Wu-Tang-inspired flair.
