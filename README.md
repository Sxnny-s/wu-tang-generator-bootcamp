# Wu-Tang Name Generator

## Goal

This project is a fun web-based Wu-Tang name generator. It asks the user 5 survey questions and, based on their answers, generates a Wu-Tang Clan-inspired name. The names are unique and playful, drawing from the user’s preferences in color, food, season, animal, and historical era.

## Features

2. **Name Generation:**
   Based on the user's answers, the app will create a name by combining their preferences in a fun, Wu-Tang Clan-inspired way.
